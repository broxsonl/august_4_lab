Once upon a time Ted was a bear. He actually wanted to be a Fubar. He cross-bred with Furby and made a Fubar child. He forced all his hopes and dreams onto his Fubar child, and Fubar couldn't take it any more, so he went into the woods and committed a merge conflict. That was the end of Fubar and Ted. The End.
